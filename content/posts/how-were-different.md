As businesses are trying to meet higher and higher customer demands, **industries are fundamentally changing their landscape.** From automobiles (Tesla) to taxis (Uber) to food delivery (Deliveroo), entire industries are having their rules re-written.

Typically creative agencies have been the providers of problem-solving and creative thinking for companies, but their traditional, waterfall approach is failing modern business. As a result, **The silos of 'creative superstars', which were once key to an agency's success, are now what's exactly causing them to fail.**

The process that is used by disruptive startups like Airbnb, Apple & Uber is not the one that agencies are currently selling.

**What 'traditional' agencies do**
- Benchmarking and research for weeks
- Charge per hour worked not results achieved
- Use as much budget and time as possible

I understand why agencies do this because when I worked at traditional agencies, I did the same. The whole model they work under was built for a different time. 

**Something has to change.**
