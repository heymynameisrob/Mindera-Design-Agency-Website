title: "How we're changing the agency model"
description: "It's never been more crucial to have design in your business. According to an inVision report, good design within your organisation can increase revenue share, product quality, time to market and customer satisfaction. Typically creative agencies have been the providers of problem solving and creative thinking for companies, but their traditional, waterfall approach is failing modern business. As a result, The silos of 'creative superstars', which were once key to an agencies success, are now what's exactly causing them to fail."

### The game has changed

Businesses are trying to meet higher and higher customer demands. It doesn’t matter what industry you’re in, **you’re competing against the likes of Uber, AirBnb and Apple** because that level of user experience and constant innovation is now the new normal. Businesses that are struggling to ‘go digital’ are having to change their entire way of working to meet the demands of a changing marketplace.

All industries are, in some way, fundamentally changing their landscape. From automobiles (Tesla) to food delivery (Deliveroo), **entire industries are having their rules re-written**. Companies are looking to their ‘superstar creatives’ and asking *‘How do I disrupt the market?’ ‘How do we innovate like Uber and Apple?’ ‘How do we go digital?’*. These people are full of the same answers they’ve been giving their clients for the last 40 years.

However, the process that was intrinsic to those disruptive startup’s success is not the one that agencies are currently selling. The fast-paced, iterative process of high growth startups is often at odds with how many design partners work with their clients.

### A startup for hire

**The big questions is 'why can't every company run like an Airbnb, Apple or Uber'?**

You’ll probably hear a million different excuses as to why not but the truth is, there isn’t a reason. Companies of all shapes and sizes are starting to realize they need to move faster and deliver more or they risk being replaced by a competitor that can. It’s telling that even giants like Walmart and IBM are starting to build internal startups to stop them from getting left behind. **Businesses are starting to ask “Why should a project take a whole year?”**

Companies that need to move fast and ship new products to the market can't afford to spend any time with an agency that needs to tick boxes and jump through hoops with their 100-person team. **A fast-paced, agile approach to product design** is what's needed to make the most of the available resources. Whether that's time, budget or team.

If they want to stay useful to their clients, agencies need to work under a new model. One that prioritizes their client's goals as if they were their own. Instead of offering ‘rockstar designers’ and weeks of benchmarking, agencies must be tailored-made and adaptive to their client's different goals. But also they must help their clients make better decisions.

### The Lean Agency
At Strike, this is exactly the philosophy on which we are built. Part of the Mindera Group, **we are a select team of designers and innovators who create a ‘product team for hire’**. We work as an internal product innovation team for the many companies under the Mindera Group as well as external clients.

Instead of becoming a third-party in which all the work is outsourced, **we focus on small, iterative projects** that are there to achieve measurable success to the people we work with. Not only that, but we help our clients make better product decisions so they can work well, even when we're not there. 

**We offer fixed, time-blocks of work in varying forms, from sprints to workshops**. Each team is tailored made to the project, each project has a clear objective and measure of success. We then work in a fixed time frame to achieve that goal and then go round an iterate.

**We allow our clients and partners to plug into a well-drilled product team** for as long as they need too. They run and operate in the same fashion as all their internal teams, working to KPI’s, quarterly goals and real-time pressures. The level of abstraction that most client/agency relationships contain is removed and what is left is a truly collaborative environment.
