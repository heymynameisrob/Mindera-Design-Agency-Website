### Background
In today’s hyper competitive retail market, brand loyalty can be an ambiguous concept. Keeping customers happy can rely on lots of different aspects, from customer service to product quality and beyond. Yet at some point, businesses reach saturation point with 'try before you buy' and other standard retention methods. But with customer retention, according to a Harvard Business Review study, driving 25% to 95% of new profits, businesses need to innovate a new way to retain customers and keep them loyal. This is exactly what Dunelm told us when they approach us to find out how they could reward their loyal customers and drive customer retention.

We partnered with them to help them turn their research and ideas into an actionable product. Forgoing traditional 'brainstorm' or 'build it and they will come' methods, we decided to run a Product Design Sprint. Whether you're developing an entirely new product or improving an existing once, it can be hard to get going. Long, drawn out meetings and planning sessions bury you in the minutia of your idea. Even if you eventually build something, you could **spend lots of money** and even more time creating **something that your customers don't want**. A PDS puts is a step-by-step process in which you define your challenges, ideate on solutions, prototype and test them with real customers.

### Looking at the landscape
Dunelm had put together a product team to look at the current loyalty/reward landscape. They found that traditional loyalty schemes have lost their charm and true customer loyalty should be earned not just bought with cheap giveaways. A lot of their current customers did engage in other companies loyalty schemes, 39% having an IKEA family card.

It was important to build a new product around this service, so we could focus on what customers could really benefit from. To ensure the longevity and ROI of this proposition, the product must evolve with consumer habit changes.

### The play-by-play
Using our Product Design Sprint framework, we managed to go from idea to product to in just 4 days. The step-by-step structure allowed the team to focus on figuring out the goals for both the brand and customer, and finding areas of opportunity we could turn into product solutions. The outcome of the Product Design Sprint is to **create a realistic prototype** of our innovative idea. We do this so we can **test with real customers**, getting the feedback that matters most. This can cut through a lot of uncertainty and gets right to the core of answering those huge business questions looming over our team. 

**Day 1**

We had Dunelm educate us on the problem space whilst we took notes in the form of 'How Might We' – these frame every question or thought into a potential challenge we can use later. This gave us enough questions and ideas to be able to map out our customers journey and see where our focus should be. To tie off the first part of the workshop, we would then set our metric for success – how will we know we achieved something? To make sure we don't get overwhelmed by ideas, we use a technique called 'Dot Voting' to help use laser focus in on what is most important. We would all vote with coloured dots and the ones that recieved the most votes would be the most important questions to us a group. This is a **huge time saver in meetings** and helps us keep focus.

Later that day, we would take our challenges and start to work up some ideas. We would discuss other products, both in and out of our immediate competitor space, that we thought were solving similar challenges well (or not so well). We believe involving the entire product team in on creative problem solving helps get the widest range of knowledge in the room. Too often, this is left just to designers and leaves out the creative capacity for problem solving that everyone posses. Our first day session would end with what we call 'Solution Sketching', in which we do a guided sketching exercise where everyone would draw rough, wireframe-style designs of how they see the product playing out. 

**Day 2**

The full-team workshop is split over 2 intense days. This allows our team to attend without impacting their calendars too much. On our second day, we take the teams sketches and run them through another round of 'dot voting'. Similar to the HMW, we do this so get a consensus on what direction we're going in. However, it's not a democracy. Our project lead has the direction role to pick out parts they feel will best serve the business. The rest of the day is used to plan out our prototype in a user journey map and storyboard.

Our storyboard will form the basis for the flow of our prototype, which we will test with users later this week. Our prototyping team would go away for the next 2 days to prototype this in full, making it feel like real software. Then we would run one-on-one user interviews with real customers to validate our prototype
