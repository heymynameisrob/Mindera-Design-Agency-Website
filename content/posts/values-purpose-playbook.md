At Strike, we believe in a way of working. As we part of the Mindera Group, we inherit our values from our wider family. Our goal is to create products with people we love. To do this, we all embody some shared values that help us keep track of the work we do.

### Honesty & Clarity
We talk and act like humans. We don't over inflate ourselves and we make sure we judge ourselves by the standards we have for everyone else. There’s a lot of bad work out there. One of the culprits is the way we talk to each other. In an industry that requires a ton of communication between clients, agencies and suppliers, it’s important not to let acronyms, “proprietary processes,” and buzzwords lead to confusion and time lost. 

### Self-organisation
We are able to organise ourselves. We don't need someone to tell us what to do in order to get the job done. Our natural instinct is to take on a challenge rather than wait for permission. We make decisions and come together as a team, with empathy at the heart of every decision we make. However, taking action independently doesn't mean we work alone. Rather, we know that we have to work as a team and all pull our weight to get where we want to go.

### Continuous Improvement
We recognize what we can always be better. There is no final victory and no final defeat. We confidently move forwards with our ideas and practices to try and be better. We take the the initiative to improve ourselves, our company and each other. We fall in love with the pursuit of solving the problem, rather than finding a solution and then putting it to rest. We prefer long-term viability rather than quick shortcuts.
