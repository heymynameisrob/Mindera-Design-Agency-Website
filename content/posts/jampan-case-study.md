title: "Designing for online recruitment for Jam Pan"
description: "Jam Pan approached Mindera, our parent company, as they needed help with their online portal. As Jam Pan grew their client base, they wanted to keep that 1–2–1 relationship they had with both suppliers (freelancers, contractors, small agencies) and their clients (businesses looking to hire)."

### Background 
Speak to any business owner and they’ll say that hiring the right talent is one of those ‘make or break’ business skills. When you’re hiring, there’s lots of pressure to get it right. You’re time poor and over-worked (or you wouldn’t be hiring). You’re skipping lunch to go through thousands of CVs’.

This is some Dave Wood, founder of Jam Pan, saw when he worked in big companies. He saw that the void that recruitment agencies were filling lacked the understanding of what the candidate needed and didn’t really solve the problem of taking away the legwork of hiring. Also, they often just pulled from a spreadsheet of candidates who used the ‘right buzzwords’. 

When you were getting a recommendation from a recruiter, they often had no clue who that person was. A lot of online platforms promised good talent but fell short on really creating that relationship and trust that companies needed.

That’s why he created Jam Pan, a company that took the pain of hiring off companies but also provided real relationships between talent and the companies wanting to hire them. If Jam Pan recommended you a candidate, it was very likely that Dave would swear by them. Jam Pan created an online portal where candidates could register their interest in being hired and Dave’s clients post jobs for candidates to browse.

### Asking the right questions

Before we kicked off the project, it was important we understood what our goal was. We know that we wanted to revitalize the original goal for the online portal; taking the load off customer services and let users use the site instead. 

This would save the company a lot of money that is currently directed to support but also free up senior members like Tori and Julia to grow the business. But how do we measure that? We discussed this at a pre-kickoff call with Jam Pan. We settled on increasing activation for current suppliers, new sign-ups for clients and re-purposing the pricing model for Jam Pan to include a basic service (access to the supplier base on the portal) and a premium service (dedicated account manager). 

This was because that on-call relationship had already been far too established for some clients and the concern from JP was if we removed that too quickly they would lose that trust.

What we found that one of the biggest reasons they were a customer of Jam Pan was because they understood the pains and frustrations that they went through, as both suppliers and clients. 

Clients were more keen to have Jam Pan work everything and some were willing to have a more premium account manager service. A lot of suppliers, however, wanted to use the site, as many of them use Indeed & Freelancers.com as well but felt the experience didn’t match up to what they got on the phone. 

Almost all of them gave up on filling in the huge amount of information needed for their profiles to just call up. Another feature was ‘bidding for jobs’. It wasn’t very popular and was really confusing for users to understand. It also bruised their egos slightly as they were all (quite rightly) proud of their expertise and didn’t want to be in a bidding war.

### Prototyping and testing quickly
here were key sections of the portal that were extremely frustrating and ultimate dead-ended the app for users. But we didn’t have a clear idea of how to solve them yet. We needed a process that allowed us time to research, prototype and test new ideas quickly that didn’t block any of the sprints in the phases.

We decided to go use a process called ‘[Lean UX](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/a-simple-introduction-to-lean-ux)’. One of the big advantages of working like this is it removes much of the “I don’t think that’s a good idea” and political infighting from the UX design process. Every idea is going to be tested and the evidence criteria clearly determined. This fits perfectly in our production process where we had a small team that needed to move fast.

<div class="full-width"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7200/1*Du4bOsXp2Rxeg414gMZO2g.jpeg"  alt="Lean UX" /></div>

Every time we felt we were making a big assumption, we prototyped our solution and tested it with 5 customers. As Jam Pan’s customers were spread out over the EU, we would set up a Google Hangouts call that we would record. Participants would share their screen and answer a few initial discovery questions. They would then perform certain tasks, whilst I (Rob), the teams PM Mita and head of customer services at Jam Pan would watch and record notes.

Afterward, we collated our feedback and identified trends with our user group. We would use these findings to validate (or invalidate) our product decisions.

### Getting new users
One of the key areas we felt needed a change was our entry point. The sign-up page not only was seeing a lot of ‘drop off’ but also requested a huge amount of information, which users said caused them to either half-fill their profile or abandon it completely. Whilst our focus was on reducing the burden of existing user struggles, we wanted to nip the problem in the bud by re-thinking our sign up flow. 

This would also feed into the onboarding as when we studied JP’s data, most users hadn’t fully completed their profiles. This meant they were missing out on job offers as both clients and JP couldn’t see if they were a good match.

<div class="full-width"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7200/1*17cH1IviPEhKyIDZ8yJ8ZQ.jpeg"  alt="New Signups" /></div>

We broke the onboarding into three parts; Soft-sign up (above) which would ask for the minimal information needed to create an account. Filling out your profile parts 1 and 2 (more about those later). The soft-sign up asked for just your name, email, and password. A clear and uncluttered UI allowed for a calmer experience, allowing the user to focus in on what they were doing. We removed any sales messages or chrome from the existing design and replaced it with the form and some lead copy. 

It wasn’t clear to users on JP’s original UI that the account was free and what the benefit of signing up was. Most of these services are paid services so I believed it was an important hook at this stage in their sales funnel to show the benefit of the platform as well as it’s 0 costs of investment.

The second part of the form (pictured above) dealt with uploading your portfolio and work information. For clients to find suppliers through Jam Pan, JP’s original system required cataloging everyone in pre-defined categories. They didn’t really have a search function so all the suppliers needed to be put in groups. We tested this system as we were told it was a big pain point from most users. **We found that literally 0 of our users felt the categories identified them and their work.** Also that when users needed to upload their work to their relative skills, the would need to complete this multiple times. 

This was because, how the system was built, it required you to add work *per skill*. Most projects spanned multiple skills, meaning that work you did for a company where you did design, illustration, copywriting and development needed to be uploaded four times.

We changed this so each project you uploaded was now ‘tagged’ with certain, more broader categories. The categorization system JP used was still there, behind the scenes, as we didn’t have scope to rebuild their internal system. But to users, they were presented with more familiar, broader terms that they could attach on a per-project basis. This would feed into their ‘Skills’ category where they could set a generalized rate for that skill set that would be visible to potential clients.

### Discovering talent easily
Once in the platform, we knew that our client user's main goal was to find suppliers they knew JP was confident in. Currently, they were all doing this on a one-to-one basis, overloading the JP staff. Along with splitting the pricing model so that only premium clients were being directly managed, we introduced a more sophisticated search feature. Clients could search for suppliers instead of post jobs, which then suppliers would bid on. This was a huge change to how the client-supplier relationship worked, but one that was welcomed. The current bidding process was a nightmare for both parties and this now gave the ability of suppliers to showcase themselves for what they are worth and the power to the clients to find the suppliers they need.

Clients would search for suppliers and add them to a ‘Shortlist’ (more below). The could see key information on the search listing and filter into 3 key areas, which we tested with clients. We asked them what are the 3 top things you look for in a potential supplier (besides their skill). The answers were availability, cost and what tools they used. These formed our three filter criteria.

<div class="full-width"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7200/1*2j5I7mJdGr3RxyHBHyVkWw.jpeg"  alt="Supplier profile" /></div>

A supplier's profile needed to show all their key information. When we spoke to clients about what they looked for; the stated that cost, quality of work and availability were key factors. We made sure that these were presented in a clear and concise way. Also, we added a reviews section that could give clients confidence if a supplier was genuine and could back up what they say.

Part of JP’s brand was their trust with their clients and suppliers. We added a feature that would showcase a ‘Jam Pan recommended’ supplier. This would be manually awarded to suppliers that have achieved a certain rating or skillset. For our initial launch, this wasn’t included but I thought it was a good idea to push forward. Something similar to AirBnb’s Super Host feature, which works really well for them.

### Making everything above board
Including legal documents into the product was tricky. We needed to make sure we worked closely with Jam Pan’s legal team to reach compliance. We would make users complete multiple checkboxes and download a PDF version of the S.O.W before the official approval. We also introduced visual signifiers to communicate the importance of the document. Outlining the details of the work, billing cycle and breakdown of the cost was crucial.

Luckily for us, when we spoke to our users they were all well suited to signing these documents but we needed to make sure that new or less able users were protected. We introduced a holding phase of a couple of days where the agreement could be nullified and confirmed, which was company policy anyway. This was to be conducted manually by JP, which wasn’t ideal, but we would explore an automated system in Phase 3.

### Outcomes

We launched the MVP in late April 2019. This was launched alongside the original portal. Switch over wasn’t too much of an issue because the usage was so low. Regardless, we piloted the MVP with a selection of Jam Pans' user base. Before the pilot launch, their founder took the product to a recruitment conference to present it as well as sign-up new clients.

In the first three months, after some marketing push, **we saw a ~100% increase in new signups** compared to the original product launch **as well as ~150% activation of existing users** to being fully on-boarded. We received overwhelmingly positive comments about the new look and feel and usable design from both suppliers and clients alike. Months after the launch, I caught up with Jam Pan not too long ago. They happily reported that the new platform had dropped the burden on customer services and growth was steady.
