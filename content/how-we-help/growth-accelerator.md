### Designing for Growth
Put simply every company needs to grow their customer base if they wish to survive. But a lot of companies lack a concrete method to drive their levers for growth. This is where Design comes in.

Design has been an afterthought when it comes to growth. Teams in charge of the companies growth usually don't have the services of a designer at hand. However, hyper-growth companies like Dropbox and Tinder have always connected growth with design. Both achieved amazing growth through offering better ways to do things.

Think about companies we know and love — Airbnb, Netflix, Google, Shopify. The secret to their success is that they’ve found ways to deliver value to customers in ways that fuel growth.

### Get growing
We have put together a structured step-by-step approach on how companies can utilise design to drive growth through their product. We have assembled a 2-day workshop, similar to the Product Design Sprint, where we can assemble your growth team, create a strategy and run 'build-measure-learn' experiments in Sprints. We also coach you how to run you own growth team, getting company wide buy-in.

We usually find around 5-7 people for our first workshop is the perfect number. Anyone can be involved in the growth design process but ideally we would recommend people who deeply understands your customer base as well as an engineer and product manager.
