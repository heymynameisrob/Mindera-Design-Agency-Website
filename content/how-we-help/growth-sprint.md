### Designing for Growth
Put simply every company needs to grow its customer base if they wish to survive. But a lot of companies lack a concrete method to drive their levers for growth. This is where Design comes in.

Well-known Silicon valley startups, like Uber, Tesla & Airbnb, have utilized a modern phenomenon within the tech industry – growth hacking. Growth Hacking is a business methodology that has adopted the continuous cycle of improvement and the 'build-measure-learn' approach and applied them to business growth – mainly customer acquisition, activation, and retention.

### How it works
We have put together a structured step-by-step approach on how companies can utilise design to drive growth through their product. We have assembled a 2-day workshop, similar to the Product Design Sprint, where we can assemble your growth team, create a strategy and run 'build-measure-learn' experiments in Sprints. We also coach you how to run your growth team, getting company-wide buy-in.

Think about companies we know and love — Airbnb, Netflix, Google, Shopify. The secret to their success is that they’ve found ways to deliver value to customers in ways that fuel growth. They are not just throwing a ton of money at Facebook ads or changing a landing page button from green to blue. They have used Design Thinking techniques and applied to grow their customer base.
