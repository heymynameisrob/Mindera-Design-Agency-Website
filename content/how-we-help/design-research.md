description: "Most companies start with fabulous idea. Most companies also fail in the first year. You wouldn't think that two are connected but often, they are. The truth is that most companies start because someone has a 'cool new idea' that they and their co-founders think is cool. But cool ideas don't make money. Solving real problems for paying customers makes money."

### Solve the problem first
One of most common mistakes is **ignoring the market** and the the problem whilst we are too focused on our **first solution**. To make sure our product is successful we need to make sure we're hitting the sweet spot with all three.

A market is a group of **people you want to sell to**. However, this isn't exclusive just to the **users of your product**. For example, if you're building software that helps children with disabilities learn then your market is both the children, the teachers and the school administrators that purchase that software.

The problem is the pain points that these people in the market are experiencing. Some of these may be usability problems, some may be pricing or accessibility. Your product is a **solution** to these problems. 

### How it works
Our research sprint is a 2-day workshop consisting of 4 phases; Discover, Understand, Analyse, Act. Our sprint brings a practically, agile approach to design research directly to company decision-makers, resulting in better outcomes for the business and its customers.

### Why run a research sprint?
Before we create great products, we need understand the problems that these products will be built to sovle. It's not as simple as looking for 'gaps in the market' or 'asking people what they want'. People often don't realise something is a problem until someone offers them a solution that resonates with them. To find out where an area of opportunity to solve a problem exists you need to get out of your building. Figuratively and physically. 

Only by **ethnographically observing, communicating and deep researching** with people can you begin to deliver insights into where to focus your efforts to provide solutions.

Our **Design Research workshop** focuses on defining your market, observing them, talking to them and delivering a customer journey and **product insights from our findings**. In our experience, we find that informal, casual observations and candid conversations can lead to the best insights without the customer even knowing they've delivered you gold.
