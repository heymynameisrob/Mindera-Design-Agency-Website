**Most companies start with fabulous idea. Most companies also fail in the first year.** 

You wouldn't think that two are connected but often, they are. The truth is that most companies start because someone has a 'cool new idea' that they and their co-founders think is cool. But cool ideas don't make money. Solving real problems for paying customers makes money.

Every new product starts with a **hypothesis**, wether you realise it or not. The first thing you company should be focusing on is **validating** (or invalidating) that hypothesis. When you begin to create a new product, you a making a ton of assumptions – trust me. Instead of focusing on loving you cool new idea, you love the problem that you're solving for.

**This is where Design Research comes in**

### The Problem, The Market & The Product
One of most common mistakes is **ignoring the market** and the the problem whilst we are too focused on our **first solution**. To make sure our product is successful we need to make sure we're hitting the sweet spot with all three.

A market is a group of **people you want to sell to**. However, this isn't exclusive just to the **users of your product**. For example, if you're building software that helps children with disabilities learn then your market is both the children, the teachers and the school administrators that purchase that software.

The problem is the pain points that these people in the market are experiencing. Some of these may be usability problems, some may be pricing or accessibility. Your product is a **solution** to these problems. 

This can seem like a very basic concept, but one that businesses miss a lot of the time.

Although some companies, like Amazon, Google & AirBnB got all the pieces right, there are millions of startups that fail because they "didn't get traction". There's a huge chance that happened because they weren't solving the right problem for the right market. 

Design research can help us find out what problems a particular market is facing, where the areas of opportunity are and what solutions resonate with them. All without firing up the production line.

### Get out of the building
Many of us communicated just fine by phone or faxing. It wasn't perfect and it was difficult to call someone in a different country but **we dealt with it, because that's all we had**. Until someone came along and showed us – **email**. 

It's not as simple as looking for 'gaps in the market' or 'asking people what they want'. People often don't realise something is a problem until someone offers them a solution that resonates with them. To find out where an area of opportunity to solve a problem exists you need to get out of your building. Figuratively and physically. 

Only by **ethnographically observing, communicating and deep researching** with people can you begin to deliver insights into where to focus your efforts to provide solutions.

### Get moving
Our **Design Research workshop** focuses on defining your market, observing them, talking to them and delivering a customer journey and **product insights from our findings**. In our experience, we find that informal, casual observations and candid conversations can lead to the best insights without the customer even knowing they've delivered you gold.

We run this over 4 days, talking to around 10-20 people in the process. We then collate the findings into a 'Insights story', that is tailored to your problem and gives you actionable steps to create the winning solutions.
