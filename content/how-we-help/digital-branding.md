Getting the right brand can seem like an ambiguous challenge. How do you communicate your company values and vision through every decision you do? Innovative leaders like Apple, Google & Netflix have dedicated brand teams that make sure everything they output 'feels' like their company. They make sure every part of their identity is deliberate and protected.

This is the kind of brand strategy and visual identity design that brand agencies offer to companies. Deep, researched strategy that takes months, even years to perfect. Brand leaders like Pentagram work closely with their huge-name clients on a day-to-day basis to guide them into making on-brand decisions.

### Branding for startups is broken

But how does this work for startups or medium-growth companies? Their budget is better spent improving and growing their business, not refining their logo and brand â€“ however much it may need doing. Brand agencies know this and will often suck up a huge amount of budget giving startups the overkill visual identity system they don't need. 

Early startups and growing companies need to pivot and react to their product growth, often changing how they will communicate to their customers. If a company starts to grow into new markets, and the communication style changes. That costly brand project might as well be chucked in the bin. 

Branding for growing companies should work like the product process. It should be lean, iterative and fast. It should only focus on the necessities and leave the rest loose and open to change and testing.
