### A recipe for innovation
The gap between a good idea and good execution is what makes or breaks a company. A Product Design Sprint is an invaluable innovation framework for new product development or overhauling an existing solution. Our process is modeled on the battle-tested Design Sprint process from Google Ventures, as well as combined with years of agency experience, behavioral science, and Agile methodologies.

All industries are, in some way, fundamentally changing their landscape. From automobiles (Tesla) to food delivery (Deliveroo), entire industries are having their rules re-written. Companies are looking to their ‘superstar creatives’ and asking *‘How do I disrupt the market?’ ‘How do we innovate like Uber and Apple?’ ‘How do we go digital?’*. These people are full of the same answers they’ve been giving their clients for the last 40 years.

### How it works
A Product Design Sprint is essentially a 1-week process, with a week of iteration and delivery bolted on afterwards. We run a **2-day intense workshop** at the start, after which we run prototyping and testing sessions with real customers. Then we follow up with a week of refinement and testing.

The outcome of your Product Design Sprint is to create a realistic prototype of your innovative idea. We do this so we can test with real customers, getting the feedback that matters most. This can cut through a lot of uncertainty and gets right to the core of answering those huge business questions looming over your team. 

Once we have our initial findings, we go back to the lab and start to refine and test until we've got something we know works. Then we can integrate into your existing production cycle, worry-free and confident.

### Why run a sprint?
Whether you’re developing an entirely new product or improving an existing once, it can be hard to get going. Long, tiring meetings and planning sessions bury you in the minutia of your idea. Even if you eventually build something, you could spend lots of money and even more, time creating something that your customers don’t want. A PDS puts structure around the messy process of creativity and innovation. It’s a perfect way to get started with any big product challenge, giving you actionable results to get the ball rolling. 

Don’t take months, take a few weeks.

### How to get started
Before you decide to run a sprint you need to define your challenge and pick your team. It’s important to make sure a range of experts are invested in the process. Despite the name, this isn’t just for “designers”. You’ll need senior stakeholders to drive decisions, people who are close to your customers, engineers and domain experts. We find that between 5-7 people (excluding a designer and facilitator) is a perfect number.
