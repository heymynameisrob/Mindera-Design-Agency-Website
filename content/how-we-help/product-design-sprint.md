Whether you're developing an entirely new product or improving an existing one, it can be hard to get going. Long, drawn-out meetings and planning sessions bury you in the minutia of your idea. Even if you eventually build something, you could spend lots of money and even more, time creating something that your customers don't want. 

### A recipe for innovation
The gap between a good idea and good execution is what makes or breaks a company. A Product Design Sprint is an invaluable innovation framework for new product development or overhauling an existing solution. Our process is modeled on the battle-tested Design Sprint process from Google Ventures, as well as combined with years of agency experience, behavioral science, and Agile methodologies.

All industries are, in some way, fundamentally changing their landscape. From automobiles (Tesla) to food delivery (Deliveroo), entire industries are having their rules re-written. Companies are looking to their ‘superstar creatives’ and asking *‘How do I disrupt the market?’ ‘How do we innovate like Uber and Apple?’ ‘How do we go digital?’*. These people are full of the same answers they’ve been giving their clients for the last 40 years.

### Don't bet it all on launch
Instead of spending months deciding, developing and delegating to launch an MVP, hoping that you got everything right, a Design Sprint allows you to shortcut the traditional 'build-measure-learn' cycle by giving you learnings without ever committing a line of code or a single dollar of marketing spend. Hit the market before any of your competitors by aligning from day 1, testing your product with real customers from the market and getting your MVP planned and ready before you build.

### How it works
A Product Design Sprint is essentially a 2-week process, with a pre-flight and delivery process bolted on. We run a 2-day intense workshop, after which we run prototyping and testing sessions with real customers. Then we follow up with a week of refinement and testing.

The goal is to sort through the noise and find an idea to test and validate in under a week. On Day 1 we work together to define the challenges and scope of the week. Day 2 is about deciding what challenges to prototype. Day 3 is about rapidly building the high fidelity prototype, which is then tested with real users on Day 4. Afterward, we take all our learnings, refine our prototype, test again and expand into a planned-out MVP.

The outcome of your Product Design Sprint is to create a realistic prototype of your innovative idea. We do this so we can test with real customers, getting the feedback that matters most. This can cut through a lot of uncertainty and gets right to the core of answering those huge business questions looming over your team. 

Once we have our initial findings, we go back to the lab and start to refine and test until we've got something we know works. Then we can integrate into your existing production cycle, worry-free and confident.

### Why run a sprint?
Whether you’re developing an entirely new product or improving an existing once, it can be hard to get going. Long, tiring meetings and planning sessions bury you in the minutia of your idea. Even if you eventually build something, you could spend lots of money and even more, time creating something that your customers don’t want. A PDS puts structure around the messy process of creativity and innovation. It’s a perfect way to get started with any big product challenge, giving you actionable results to get the ball rolling. 

Don’t take months, take a few weeks.

### How to get started
Before you decide to run a sprint you need to define your challenge and pick your team. It’s important to make sure a range of experts are invested in the process. Despite the name, this isn’t just for “designers”. You’ll need senior stakeholders to drive decisions, people who are close to your customers, engineers and domain experts. We find that between 5-7 people (excluding a designer and facilitator) is a perfect number.
