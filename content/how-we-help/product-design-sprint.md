Design is transforming how organizations work. According to a McKinsey report, businesses that utilise design well see almost double in revenue share and return to shareholders. That is the engine behind massive growth in design-led companies today. But design is vague and hard to get to grips with. What do we mean by 'design'? The famous inventor and engineer Charles Kettering once said “If you have always done it that way, it is probably wrong.” To get your business to utilise design to compete, you need think different how you approach design.

Building a great design culture is really difficult. It requires experienced designers and lot of investment. Futhermore, the return of that investment can be slow as trying to get design to permeate all parts of your organisation can be arduous and messy. What you need is battle-tested, formula for great innovation. Before you invest huge amounts of time and money in design, you need a framework that your whole business can plug into. This is the ‘Design Sprint’.

### Why run a sprint?
Developing entirely new products or game-changing features isn’t an easy task. The greatest risk is that users don’t find our solutions accessible or desirable. This is where a design sprint comes in – it is the ideal tool kit to help all stakeholders and their teams to align and test assumptions in a short amount of time. The sprint enables us to validate with real customers at the beginning of the product development process, setting the team up for long-term success.

Whether you're developing an entirely new product or improving an existing once, it isn't an easy task. You can just throw clever people into a room and hope magic will happen. You could spend lots of money and even more time creating something that your customers don't find accessible or desireable. A Product Design Sprint puts structure around the messy process of creativity and innovation. It's a perfect way to get started with any big product challenge, giving you actionable results to get the ball rolling. Don't take months, take a few weeks.

### How it breaks down 
A Product Design Sprint is a step-by-step process for developing great ideas to critical business questions through design, prototyping, and validation. It utilizes Design Thinking practices into a easy to follow recipe. You can get more done in less time without all the chaos and confusion.

A Product Design Sprint is essentially a **4 phased process**, based on the Sprint method pioneered by GV. We run a **4-day intense workshop**, followed by **a week of refinement and testing**. 

The goal is to sort through the noise and find an idea to test and validate in under a week. On **Day 1** we work in together to define the challenges and scope of the week. **Day 2** is about deciding what challenges to prototype. **Day 3** is about rapidly building the high fidelity prototype, which is then tested with real users on **Day 4**. Afterwards we take all our learnings, refine our prototype, test again and expand into a planned-out MVP.

The outcome of your Design Sprint is to create a realistic prototype of your innovative idea. We do this so we can test with real customers, getting the feedback that matters most. This can cut through a lot of uncertainty and gets right to the core of answering those huge business questions looming over your team.

Once you have your customer insights, you now have a workable set of next step. Maybe you need to tweak the idea a little. Maybe you can go straight into fleshing this out for production. Maybe you need to go back to the drawing board. The answers you have at the end of the week are actionable. You've not wasted much time at all if you have to make a pivot.

### Get prepared
Before you decide to run a sprint you need to define your challenge and pick your team. It's important to make sure a range of experts are invested in the process. Despite the name, this isn't just for "designers". You'll need senior stakeholders to drive decisions, people who are close to your customers, engineers and domain experts. We find that between 5-7 people (excluding a designer and facilitator) is a perfect number.
