According to a McKinsey report, **businesses that utilise design** well see almost **double in revenue share** and return to shareholders. That is the engine behind massive growth in design-led companies today. But how to get a **well-oiled innovation machine** up a running? 

**You use a Product Design Sprint**.

Despite the name, a Product Design Sprint isn't the same as an Agile Sprint. A PDS is **a structured way of working** that uses a combination of Design Thinking and Lean methodologies ideas to **solve big challenges quickly** and velocity to the idea process.

### Why run a sprint?
Whether you're developing an entirely new product or improving an existing once, it can be hard to get going. Long, drawn out meetings and planning sessions bury you in the minutia of your idea. Even if you eventually build something, you could **spend lots of money** and even more time creating **something that your customers don't want**. A PDS puts structure around the messy process of creativity and innovation. It's a perfect way to get started with any big product challenge, giving you actionable results to get the ball rolling. **Don't take months, take a few weeks**.

### How it breaks down 
A Product Design Sprint is essentially a **4 staged process**, based on the Sprint method pioneered by GV. We run a **4-day intense workshop**, followed by **a week of refinement and testing**. These two stages are flanked by a **pre-flight stage **to get everyone on the same page and a **delivery stage** to finalize any details and package everything together.

The goal is to sort through the noise and find an idea to test and validate in under a week. On **Day 1** we work in together to define the challenges and scope of the week. **Day 2** is about deciding what challenges to prototype. **Day 3** is about rapidly building the high fidelity prototype, which is then tested with real users on **Day 4**. Afterwards we take all our learnings, refine our prototype, test again and expand into a planned-out MVP.

The outcome of your Product Design Sprint is to **create a realistic prototype** of your innovative idea. We do this so we can **test with real customers**, getting the feedback that matters most. This can cut through a lot of uncertainty and gets right to the core of answering those huge business questions looming over your team. 

Once we have our initial findings, we go back to the lab and start to refine and test until we've got **something we know works**. Then we can integrate into your existing production cycle, **worry-free and confident**.

### Get prepared
Before you decide to run a sprint you need to **define your challenge and pick your team**. It's important to make sure a range of experts are invested in the process. Despite the name, **this isn't just for "designers"**. You'll need senior stakeholders to drive decisions, people who are close to your customers, engineers and domain experts. We find that **between 5-7 people** (excluding a designer and facilitator) is a perfect number.
