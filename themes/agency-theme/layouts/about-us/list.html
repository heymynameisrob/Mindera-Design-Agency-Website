            <h2>A different kind of agency</h2>
            <p>Formed by a team of experienced designers and leaders, we started to challenge the tired old agency model
              of building products.</p>
            <p>Our agency is different. We’re built to be lean and collaborative. We are dedicated to creating the best
              products and services, without wasting your time or budget.</p>
            <p><strong>Strike Design Labs are part of the Mindera Group, built to be a radically different approach to
                designing products.</strong></p>

        <h4>Whenever a company hires an agency, they are plugging into a 40 year old mindset. Most of your budget is
          going on box-ticking, hoop-jumping busywork to keep the agency afloat. Really, they should function like a
          startup – an entrepreneur for hire.</h4>
