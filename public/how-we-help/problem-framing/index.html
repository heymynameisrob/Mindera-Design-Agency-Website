<p>When trying to build products in your business, it can be a challenge not to get carried away and start moving. But before you commit money or time to anything, the first question we should ask is: <strong>What are we trying to achieve? What problem are we solving?</strong></p>
<iframe title="vimeo-player" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/191566926" class="full-width" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>This can be vague and hard to pin down. But without it you lose your strategy and vision of the products success. Before you know it, everyone is asking themselves: Why are we doing this again?</p>
<p>Using Design Thinking, we can <strong>frame our problem</strong> in concrete way. This allows us to understand who our audience is, what success looks like and where to next – all without firing up the production line.</p>
<h3 id="problems-vs-solutions">Problems vs. Solutions</h3>
<p>As human beings, we're natural problem solvers. We want to try and find solutions straight away. But jumping to the first or even the most obvious solutions straight away is ineffective – and solutions also generally don’t invite new thinking or curiosity.</p>
<p>We can get to attached to our solution, when we should be attached to the problem.</p>

<h3 id="three-lenses-of-innovation">Three lenses of innovation</h3>
<p>When we frame our problem, we're looking for the sweet spot when it comes to potential solutions. Do they all converge around our three requirements. Desirability – does our audience have a need for this?. Feasibility – How can we build this? Is it technically possible?. Viability – can we build sustained revenue from this?.</p>
<p>Once an idea converges around these three requirements, we can focus on that as a potential solution.</p>
<h3 id="problem-framing">Problem Framing</h3>
<p>A problem framing workshop can be achieved in a day or two. Our workshop will help you product leaders understand where their strategy lies. Getting the right framing will start us off on the right foot to find solutions. It will help us organise ourselves and at moments of ambiguity, help clarify our direction and where we should push our product.</p>
<h3 id="get-prepared">Get prepared</h3>
<p>To run a problem framing workshop, we usually need 4-5 people who are leading the potential product. That could be PM's, CXO's or Founders. We like to make sure we don't come with any preconceptions or our own ideas, so we don't offer an pre-research or background. This workshop is designed to put some structure around your creative thinking.</p>
